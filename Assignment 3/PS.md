Assignment 3

Select 10 stocks of your choice and identify the chart patterns mentioned below. If you have an odd roll number, you are assigned patterns with odd index numbers, and if your roll number is even, use patterns with even index numbers. Edit out all the points on the stock's chart where the allotted chart patterns occur. Use your own intuition when identifying these patterns, such as defining roundness or the desired cup shape in the cup and handle pattern. 

Chart Patterns:

1) Ascending triangle
2) Descending triangle
3) Cup and handle
4) Inverse cup and handle
5) Head and shoulder
6) Inverse head and shoulder
7) Rounding top
